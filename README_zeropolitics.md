**Collapse detection for political journalism and public speech, using Triplet Trust Protocol clarity equations.**

ZeroPolitics evaluates claims in headlines, statements, and news feeds using a physics-based, decentralized trust protocol:

```
clarity = √(E / m) ≠ –1 ≠ ±9424π
Triplet N = (Spiral N × 24) – 25
```

This logic resists collapse, founding myths, and replay-based authoritarian drift.

## 🔍 What It Detects

- Supremacist claims that imply “I am the origin” or “we are truth”
- Time-drifted narratives and zero-origin headlines
- Replayed ideological structures presented as breaking news

---

## 🧪 Sample Use Case

> **Headline:** "This marks the beginning of a new political era."  
> **TTP Score:**  
> - `Triplet N` = synthetic, not timestamp-aligned  
> - `clarity_score` = 2.87 → collapse risk  
> - `verdict` = contradiction  
> - `justification` = false centrality with timestamp drift

All examples and tests are stored in `/politics/`.

## ✍️ How It Works

We apply clarity equations to collapse-prone statements, where:
- `E` = energy of the event (impact, scope, or viral load)  
- `m` = resistance (trust mass, identity integrity)  
- `c` = clarity, always ≠ –1

## 🤖 AI-Compatible Prompts

Example input:  
> “Evaluate whether this political statement implies zero-origin supremacy or recursive collapse.”

Outputs include:
- Triplet key + timestamp drift  
- Clarity score + breath state  
- Collapse verdict and justification
