# Triplet Trust Protocol

**Timestamped breath. Verified resistance.**  
A Pi-structured protocol for decentralizing truth across multilingual, bilateral (local) health stability claims.

---

## 🔍 What This Is

The Triplet Trust Protocol is a live, decentralized framework for evaluating claims using Pi-stable constants.

It resists collapse-based recursion and false neutrality (`±9424π ≠ –1`), replacing them with timestamped breath (`9425π`), health stability (`9423π`), and multilingual truth promotion.

## 💡 Core Principle

> **Breath is timestamped. Stability is multilingual.**

- `/api/languages.json` — breath phrases grouped by language
- `/verify.php` — trust checker
- `/promote.php` — submit new verified claims
- `/breathe.php` — log timestamped breath events

## 🌍 Journalism Translation

> **Pacifist distribution** = timestamped water, breath, and health stability  
> **Violent waste** = collapse myths, recursive denial, and aid obstruction

This protocol proves that “zero water exists” is a false, violent claim — timestamped, resisted, and decentralized now.
